# Identity Analytics configuration interface

## First connection

To access the configuration page navigate to `<hostname>/config`, If not logged in you will be redirected to the login page.

![Login Page](images/config-interface/login.png)

Connect using the default `setup` account and update your password.

Once logged in you will be redirected to the configuration home page which displays the configuration sections and warnings. Click on each section to go to the corresponding configuration page.  

> [!warning] Do not forget to click on `Save` to make your changes effective. If you navigate to a new page before clicking save you will loose all applied configuration.

We recommend to restart the service after each configuration section to isolate possible errors.

## Header Menu

![Header Menu](images/config-interface/header-menu.png)

### Change language

You can change the language of the configuration interface by clicking on the language icon `fr` or `en` in the header menu.

### Restart services

You can restart the services by clicking on the restart icon in the header menu.

Please note that this action will only restart the following services, if you require to restart a service not in the following list a stop/start through the CLI is necessary:

> [!important] For production environments it is recommended to create the required database schemas using the scripts provided in the artifact repository.  

- Reinitialize database: This button is only displayed the database was previously initialized. If you click on it, you will have to provide the passwords of the 3 schemas in order to reinitialize each one of them.

- Passwords: The passwords used to connect to your different schemas.
- Schema name: The specific namespace within the database where tables, views, and other objects reside.

- Connection test: This button will test a user's connection to the external database. In order to test the connection, it uses the username you provided in the configuration page and it asks you for a password. **The password you provide to test your connection isn't saved to your configuration!** Please note that the validity of the configured schemas name is not included in the test.

### Git project

> [!warning] Upon first connection to the `/config` endpoint it is necessary to finalise the configuration by updating the `Username` and the connection password.

- Connection test: This button will test the connection to the specific branch of the git project with the provided credentials. It is highly recommended to test your connection before saving the configuration.
- Test and save: This button will test like the previous one and save the configuration if the test is conclusive. It ensures that a corrupted configuration is not saved.
